# Check It
Check It (also styleised as CheckIt) is a todo tray application made with vue and electron. The reason that this application was made is because it will help solve some of the issues with normal todo apps like:
- non-obtrusiveness
- simple UI
- prioritization
- reordering
- quick entry/capture of new tasks
- pretty design
- easy to use
